'W63.txt' and 'W90.txt' are files containing the $63 \times 63$ and $90 \times 90$ matrices respectively.
'P63.txt' and 'P90.txt' are files consisting of the partition of the previously mentioned matrices respectively to maximize the sum of $L_1$ values of the two partitioned matrices respectively.
The 'S63_0.txt', 'S63_1.txt', 'S90_0.txt', 'S90_1.txt' are strategy vectors belonging to the partitioned matrices.
The 'check.m' is a Matlab script with the input of the previously mentioned matrices and vectors that calculates the best $S_{max}$ value found by us.
